#by line:
#read in the data, use read_delim instead of read.csv because the csv file was not defaulted to using , as column separaters, you need to specify that you want to use ; as delim
#clean col names
#mutate to add new col with percentage of pop for white
#update the existing col with new version to replace , with .
#convert percent elevated to number, from charac to numeric

```

```{r}
#names(stl_lead), looks messy

#column names now in lower snake case

#stl_lead_prop <- data.frame(stl_lead, stl_lead$prop_white)
#stl_lead_prop
#dplyr::mutate(prop_white = 100 * (stl_lead$white / stl_lead$totalPop))
#will create a new column new_col that contains the value of col_a / col_b
```

## This figure shows that white people tend to have lower lead levels in their blood.

```{r, fig.width=7,fig.height=9}
#In a new code chunk, create a scatterplot graph of the percentage of children in each census tract with elevated blood lead levels (pctElevated) versus the percent of each census tract identifying as white.

stl_lead_plot <- ggplot(data = stl_lead, aes(x = pct_elevated, y = prop_white)) +
                            geom_point (aes(size = pct_elevated), alpha = 0.7, color = "red")


stl_lead_plot

#Customize by updating several aesthetics (e.g. size, opacity (see alpha =), color, etc.)
#Store the scatterplot as stl_lead_plot
#Have the scatterplot returned in the knitted html - customize the size that it appears when knitted
#Also save a .png of the scatterplot to figs, with dimensions of (6 x 5) (width x height)
#In text above or below the scatterplot, write 1 - 2 sentences describing the overall trend that you observe from #your graph

```


```{r, fig.width=6,fig.height=5}

```

```{r, fig.width=6,fig.height=5}
#Create a histogram of only the pctElevated column in the data frame
#Customize the fill, color, and size aesthetics - test some stuff! Feel free to make it awful.
#Once youâ€™ve played around with customization, export the histogram as a .jpg to the figs folder
#Make sure the histogram also shows up in your knitted html (customize the size)

hist_elev <- ggplot(data = stl_lead, aes(x = pct_elevated)) +
