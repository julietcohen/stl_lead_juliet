#read in the data, use read_delim instead of read.csv because the csv file was not defaulted to using , as column separaters, you need to specify that you want to use ; as delim
#clean col names
#mutate to add new col with percentage of pop for white
#update the existing col with new version to replace , with .
#convert percent elevated to number, from charac to numeric
